## 🔒 Security Notes

**IMPORTANT**: This is a demo application using localStorage for data persistence.

For production deployment, you MUST:
1. ✅ Implement backend API (Node.js/Express recommended)
2. ✅ Add database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
3. ✅ Implement authentication & authorization
4. ✅ Add HTTPS (Netlify provides this automatically)
5. ✅ Secure API endpoints
6. ✅ Implement CSRF protection
7. ✅ Add rate limiting
8. ✅ Sanitize user inputs

## 📊 Data Storage

**Current**: Browser localStorage (suitable for demo only)

**Production Recommendation**:
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
- Authentication: JWT or session-based
- File Storage: AWS S3 or Cloudinary for uploads

## 🎨 Customization

### Branding
Update school information in:
- `js/school-config.js` - School details, grades, fees
- `css/design-system.css` - Colors and styling
- `css/public-blog.css` - Public site styling

### Contact Information
Update in all HTML files:
- Phone numbers
- Email addresses
- Physical address
- Social media links

## 📚 Documentation

- **Quick Start Guide**: `BLOG_QUICK_START.md`
- **Implementation Plan**: See artifacts folder
- **Walkthrough**: See artifacts folder

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Backend**: Uses localStorage (not suitable for production)
2. **No Authentication**: Admin portal has no login (needs implementation)
3. **No Email Notifications**: Simulated only (needs backend integration)
4. **File Storage**: Base64 in localStorage (needs proper file storage)
5. **No Database**: All data in browser (needs backend database)
